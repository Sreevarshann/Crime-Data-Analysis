## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: Publicly available crime data.
- **Size**: 800,000+ records with 28 columns.
- **Format**: CSV (`Crime_Data_from_2020_to_Present.csv`).
- **Data Includes**:
  - Crime type, location, and time of occurrence.
  - Victim demographics (age, gender, and descent).
  - Features like weapon use, economic data, and more.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍  
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` → Data manipulation
  - `numpy` → Numerical computations
  - `matplotlib & seaborn` → Data visualization
  - `statsmodels` → Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA)
  - `scipy` → Statistical Analysis

## 📈 Key Findings
✔ **Theft & Assault** are the most common crimes.  
✔ **Crime rates peak on weekends**, especially vehicle theft.  
✔ **Crime rates are projected to decline after 2024**, based on ARIMA forecasting.  
✔ Economic factors show **weak correlation** with crime rates, highlighting other drivers.
